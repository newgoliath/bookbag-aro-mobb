= Azure AD for Cluster authentication

Authentication to your cluster is best managed via Azure Active Directory.

Depending on which environment your instructor deployed this authentication is either preconfigured or you need to set it up.

Your instructor should tell you how your environment was set up.

You will need to do *one* of the following two modules:

* link:./1a-configure-aad[Configure Azure Active Directory for Cluster Authentication]
* link:./1b-explore-aad[Explore Azure Active Directory for Cluster Authentication]
